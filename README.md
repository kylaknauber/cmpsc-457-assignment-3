CMPSC 457 Assignment 3:
This project consists of a downloaded 3D scene in which I applied the use of lighting, shading, and textures on various objects. My scene is a log cabin in the forest, so I used a lot of point lighting,
along with dark yellow sunlight to simulate a dim sunset. I used 6 different textures on the house, deck, rocks, ground, etc, to add more realism to the componenets
